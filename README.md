# 🔥 IoT-Based Smoke Detector System with ThingSpeak Integration

This project is an IoT-based Smoke Detection System that identifies smoke in real-time and sends sensor data to the cloud using **ThingSpeak**. It alerts the user with a buzzer and LED, while also enabling remote monitoring through live graphs.

## 📌 Features

- 🔍 Real-time smoke detection
- ☁️ Live data monitoring on ThingSpeak
- 🧠 Arduino-based implementation
- 🔔 Buzzer & LED alert system
- 💻 Simple hardware + cloud integration
- 🎥 Project explanation included

---

## 🧰 Components Used

- Arduino Uno
- MQ-2 Smoke Sensor
- ESP8266 Wi-Fi Module
- Buzzer
- LED
- Resistors
- Breadboard & Jumper Wires

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **MQ-2 Sensor** detects the smoke level in the environment.
2. If smoke level exceeds a threshold, **buzzer** and **LED** get activated.
3. Simultaneously, the sensor data is sent to **ThingSpeak** over Wi-Fi using ESP8266.
4. The user can monitor the live data remotely from any browser.
