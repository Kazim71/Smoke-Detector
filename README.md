## 📌 Features

- 🔍 Real-time smoke detection
- 🧠 Arduino-based implementation
- 🔔 Buzzer & LED alert system
- 💻 Simple circuit with clear explanation
- 🎥 Project demonstration included

## 🧰 Components Used

- Arduino Uno
- MQ-2 Smoke Sensor
- Buzzer
- LED
- Resistors
- Jumper Wires
- Breadboard

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. The MQ-2 sensor detects the smoke or gas in the environment.
2. When smoke exceeds a threshold value, the buzzer is triggered and LED lights up.
3. The Arduino code reads analog values and processes them to trigger alerts.
